                        <p>The previous design felt a bit outdated, with the main UI element being a central carousel featuring three cards that showcased the companyâ€™s value propositions: speed, quality, and service. The cards used retro 1950s-style graphics, with the rocket ship and telephone illustrations being more effective than the quality dial in conveying the message.</p>

                        <h2>After</h2>
                        <p>The new design of connerexterior.com replaces the carousel and retro graphics with a sleek, modern look. The page now opens with a bold value proposition and immediately presents three service cards, each offering a brief explanation, straightforward pricing, and a clear call to action. The cards feature vibrant, organic shapes and subtle animations that catch the eye and encourage users to click the CTA, creating a more engaging experience.</p>
